# Brain_Tumor_Detection
This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for detecting brain tumors from brain MRI images. The CNN architecture is designed to analyze the image data and classify whether a tumor is present or not.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of brain MRI images. The dataset can be obtained from Kaggle from the following [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection)
